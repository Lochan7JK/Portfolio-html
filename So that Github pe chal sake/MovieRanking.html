    "Arey Ooo Saamba! Kitne aadmi the"
    Amongst Bollywood's Best.
    What to say of this 'almost perfect Bollywood movie' and arguably among the greatest from the industry, it had absolutely everything in it, a blend of all the facets of Hindi cinema, yet modelled on the Western movies running in Hollywood at that time and before. No need to elaborate on any of the elements of this film, as any Hindi movie lover would know; but to mention just one, I would talk of the action sequences in the running train which were such perfectly shot that they seemed way ahead of its time. It had a slow opening in the theatres but gathered steam in the second week and o boy, it never looked back from there. I still remember it running as late as the 90s in some theatre or the other in the city and had a release every year whenever they found a slot for this classic. If the number of times a movie been watched by any viewer is the question, it would perhaps make the Guinness Books by now. 9/10

 <h3>Anand</h3>
<p>
    Anand is a movie which speaks more than it scripts. It tells us more than its characters narrates the story. The impressive character no doubt is of Rajesh Khannna, but Amitabh is too much impressive. The "Anand" tells us how a man decided and then spent rest of his short life.

 <h3>Don</h3>
 <p>Knock knock! "Who's it?" inquires a voice hiding in a hotel room. "DON!" declares his assertive boss from the other end. The guy understands his end is near and flees the hotel in a Kaali peeli cab. Unfortunately, he's been framed and the Don (Amitabh Bachchan) reveals himself to him. It's a scene which highlights the towering importance of its titular character. 'Don' as he is simply called. No more, no less...

    Amitabh Bachchan played this dreaded gangster as well as his adorable 'bhaiyya' doppelganger Vijay fantastically enough to clinch his second Filmfare trophy.  Zeenat Aman (my childhood crush) and Pran Saahab played the perfect foil and the portly Om Shivpuri provided the Kahaani mein twist factor. In short, Don offered perfect entertainment for all ages ...and all times. 

    The classic was remade successfully in 2006 with SRK in lead. It might be remade again after a couple of decades. But Chandra Barot's attempt cannot be bettered. No way. Never!!!

<h3>Mera Naam Joker</h3>
 <p>
    In fact, the clown doll is a metaphor for Raju's pure heart which he keeps giving to his lady love only to find it return back to him. Like Guide (1965) and only like Guide, Mera Naam Joker is a philosophical take on human emotions. Both are my topmost favorite movies for this reason. Strongly recommended!!

<h3>Padosan</h3>
 <p>
    With such a whacky plot, there are laughs aplenty. Add master comedians Mehmood and Kishore Kumar and a funny looking Sunil Dutt, you have the perfect recipe for a hilariously whacky romantic comedy. Saira Banu, oozing of charm is quite good as the spoilt Bindu. Music is also excellent.
